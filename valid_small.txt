So  for  the  overall  salt  content  you  are  saying  that  would  be  13  per  cent  of  6  grams,  (6  grams  being  the  Recommended  Daily  Allowance)  is  this  correct?  If  I  am  wrong  with  this  please  advise  of  the  correct  numbers.  sb.	labels:@150296  You're  spot  on  Shar,  the  salt  content  in  this  product  equals  to  13%  of  an  average  adult's  daily  reference  intake.

text:@GoDaddyHelp  Hi!  I  recently  purchased  a  Pro  Reseller  Plan.  I'm  confused  as  to  how  to/where  to  go  to  set  up  the  free  hosting  that  comes  with  it.  Could  you  please  provide  some  guidance?	labels:@151544  Hi,  you  should  be  able  to  follow  these  instructions  to  setup  the  hosting:  https://t.co/NGay4M1DQi  ^KayJay
text:@GoDaddyHelp  Thank  you!  I'm  managing  my  client's  account.  If  they  had  already  previously  purchased  hosting,  does  that  hosting  become  the  'free  hosting'  after  having  purchase  a  Reseller  Plan?  Hope  my  question  makes  sense.	labels:@151544  No.  Existing  hosting  would  remain  as  it  is.  When  you  purchase  the  reseller  plan,  any  hosting  you  receive  with  it  would  be  added  to  your  account  at  that  time  as  new  hosting.  ^Heather
text:@GoDaddyHelp  I  got  it  now.  Thank  you!	labels:@151544  Happy  to  hear  it.  You're  most  welcome.  We'll  be  here  if  you  need  us  again  in  the  future.  ^Heather
text:@GoDaddyHelp  Oh,  one  last  question!  When  changing  a  hosting  account's  domain,  a  step  in  the  help  guide  says,  "Remove  any  subdomains  of  your  primary  domain  name  before  you  can  change  it."  Does  that  include  addons  domains?  https://t.co/gI2T5oRlst	labels:@151544  Yes,  you  would  need  to  remove  any  subdomain  of  the  primary  domain  you're  changing.  ^Heather 	episode_done:True

text:@sainsburys  Any  chance  of  a  response  to  this  question?  Thanks  https://t.co/Xikve58NYM	labels:@155430  Sorry  for  the  wait  Chrissie!  I  can  confirm  they  are  not  agents  of  Sainsburys,  they're  a  third  party  company  operating  in  some  of  our  car  parks.  It'd  be  best  to  get  in  touch  with  them  directly  for  further  assistance.  Marc
text:@sainsburys  Thanks  for  the  reply.  Now  I'm  puzzled.  Not  an  agent  of  Sainsbury's?  So  who  gives  them  permission  to  run  your  car  parks?  I  suspect  it  will  be  Sainsbury's	labels:@155430  Hey  Chrissie,  the  car  park  facilities  are  overseen  by  Horizon.  The  store  does  own  the  space  in  this  particular  instance,  but  we  don't  engage  in  the  running  of  it,  or  ticketing  process.  So  the  manager  can  speak  to  them  on  your  behalf.  Corey 	episode_done:True
