text:@76495 @91226 Please help! Spotify Premium skipping through songs constantly on android tablet &amp; bluetooth speaker. Tried everything!	labels:@105840 Hi there! What device is this happening on? If you could also let us know the Android and Spotify versions you're using, that'd be great /AY
text: @SpotifyCares Thanks! Version 8.4.22.857 armv7 on anker bluetooth speaker on Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2016) Model SM-T280 Does distance from speaker matter?	labels: @105840 Thanks. The distance could possibly affect playback. Does logging out &gt; restarting your device &gt; logging back in make a difference? /AY
text: @SpotifyCares No, but I've moved speaker to about 1 metre away and it's not skipping at the mo - it was about 3 or 4 metres away before. Fingers crossed!	labels:@105840 That's great to hear. If anything comes up, just let us know. We'll carry on helping out ðŸ™‚ /AY
