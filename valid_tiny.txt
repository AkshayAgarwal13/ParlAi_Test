text:Gotta  luv  @VirginTrains  finally  get  2  call  cntr,  they  tried  to  charge  me  ¬£176  for  a  ticket  which  can  b  purchased  for  ¬£88  online  https://t.co/I7rkohYqaI	labels:@115919  When  amending  a  ticket  the  system  would  show  a  fare  that  matches  your  previous  purchase,  but  this  may  be  higher  ^CB 	episode_done:True
text:@VirginTrains  Hi-  does  the  new  app  have  an  option  to  buy  an  open  return?	labels:@115921  Yes  it  does.  You  need  to  select  the  return  journey  then  in  the  ticket  flexibility  menu  you  can  select  open  return  ^CB 	episode_done:True
text:@VirginTrains  For  at  least  the  third  time  this  year,  I  will  miss  the  meeting  I  especially  took  the  train  for  in  the  first  place.  So  often  late.  No  refund  because  it  "doesn't  qualify".  Next  season  =  car.	labels:@115923  Hi  Andy,  really  sorry  to  hear  this.  Which  service  are  you  travelling  on  please?  ^HP

text:@VirginTrains  Always  some  supposedly  acceptable  reason,  yes  I  get  that,  but  when  one  uses  the  trains  every  week  and  spends  a  lot  of  money,  for  it  to  be  late  regularly  is  just  not  acceptable.	labels:@115923  I  understand  the  frustration  this  causes,  Andy  ^CB
text:@VirginTrains  Oh,  that's  nice.  What  are  you  doing  about  it?  What  are  you  targets  next  year?	labels:@115923  These  delays  are  out  of  our  control,  but  we  do  work  with  Network  Rail  to  try  and  reduce  any  problems  ^CB
text:@VirginTrains  What  are  your  targets  for  next  season?  I  see  your  prices  go  up,  so  I  assume  you've  set  performance  targets  reflective  of  that.	labels:@115923  We  don't  have  that  information  here  I'm  afraid  Andy  ^CB 	episode_done:True
