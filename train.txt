text:@76495 @91226 Please help! Spotify Premium skipping through songs constantly on android tablet &amp; bluetooth speaker. Tried everything!	labels:@105840 Hi there! What device is this happening on? If you could also let us know the Android and Spotify versions you're using, that'd be great /AY
text: @SpotifyCares Thanks! Version 8.4.22.857 armv7 on anker bluetooth speaker on Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2016) Model SM-T280 Does distance from speaker matter?	labels: @105840 Thanks. The distance could possibly affect playback. Does logging out &gt; restarting your device &gt; logging back in make a difference? /AY
text: @SpotifyCares No, but I've moved speaker to about 1 metre away and it's not skipping at the mo - it was about 3 or 4 metres away before. Fingers crossed!	labels:@105840 That's great to hear. If anything comes up, just let us know. We'll carry on helping out ðŸ™‚ /AY
text: @SpotifyCares Brilliant thanks ðŸ˜Š	labels: @105840 You're welcome! If there's anything else we can help with, just give us a shout. We're here for you ðŸ˜‰	episode_done:True
text: Hey @Tesco, your website's broken. It's telling me there are no delivery slots for the next 3 weeks, which I find slightly unlikely.	labels:@105856 Hi there, could you try deleting your cache and cookies and reinstalling the app if using it? This should fix the issue :) - Dani
text:@Tesco Will I lose all the shopping I've done if I delete the cache/cookies (not using app)?	labels:@105856 Hi there, as long as you sign out of your account prior to deleting your cache &amp; cookies, you'll still have a full basket :) Thanks - Mike
text:@Tesco Done all that. Still telling me there are no delivery slots whatsoever.	labels:@105856 Can you DM me your full name, address and email? I'd be happy to look into this further for you :) Thanks - Mike	 		 episode_done:True
